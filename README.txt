pyTUIO
======
A Python library that understands the `TUIO protocol`_.
-------------------------------------------------------

This library is able to receive and parse data defined in the TUIO protocol,
which was specially designed for transmitting the state of tangible objects and multi-touch control on a table surface.

E.g., the reacTIVision_ Software is using this protocol to send positional
data of so called fiducials_ that can be used to build tangible tables.
